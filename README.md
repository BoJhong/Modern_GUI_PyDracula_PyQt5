# High DPI
> Qt Widgets is an old technology and does not have good support for high DPI settings, making these images look distorted when your system has DPI applied above 100%.
You can minimize this problem using a workaround by applying this code below in "main.py" just below the import of the Qt modules.
```python
# ADJUST QT FONT DPI FOR HIGH SCALE
# ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
from modules import *
from widgets import *
os.environ["QT_FONT_DPI"] = "96"
```

# Running
> Inside your preferred terminal run the commands below depending on your system, remembering before installing Python 3.8+ and PyQt5 "pip install PyQt5".
> ## **Windows**:
```console
python main.py
```
> ## **MacOS and Linux**:
```console
python3 main.py
```
# Compiling
> ## **Windows**:
```console
python setup.py build
```

# Project Files And Folders
> **main.py**: application initialization file.

> **main.ui**: Qt Designer project.

> **resources.qrc**: Qt Designer resources, add here your resources using Qt Designer.

> **setup.py**: cx-Freeze setup to compile your application (configured for Windows).

> **themes/**: add here your themes (.qss).

> **modules/**: module for running PyDracula GUI.

> **modules/app_functions.py**: add your application's functions here.

> **modules/app_settings.py**: global variables to configure user interface.

> **modules/resources_rc.py**: "resources.qrc" file compiled for python using the command: ```pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py```.

> **modules/ui_functions.py**: add here only functions related to the user interface / GUI.

> **modules/ui_main.py**: file related to the user interface exported by Qt Designer. You can compile it manually using the command: ```pyuic5 main.ui > ui_main.py```.
After exporting in .py, change the line "import resources_rc" to "from . resources_rc import *" to use as a module.

> **images/**: put all your images and icons here before converting to Python (resources_rc.py) ```pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py```.
